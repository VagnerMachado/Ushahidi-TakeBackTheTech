This application uses Ushahidi Deployments and an API call to TakeBackTheTeck.net to retrieve and
 parse incident data. A Splash layout provides the user with a brief description of the app and
 its purpose. A GoogleMap Fragment is then loaded with markers based on each incidents'
 location. Upon being clicked, each markers shows a title and snippet with data for each incident.
 The detailed description for each class and method used can be found in their Javadoc comments
